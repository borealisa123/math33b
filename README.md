My notes for Fall 2019 Quarter Math 33B with Professor Haofei Fan

Ignore my doodles. Or don't ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

### mistakes
- 10/11 - a differential equation Pdx + Qdy = 0 is homogeneous if both coefficients P and Q are homogeneous of the same degree
- 10/29 study guide thing - for 1st order Existence and Uniqueness, y' = ay + f, f is a function of t and y. both f(t,y) and df/dy need to be continuous
- 10/29 study guide thing - wronskian is != 0 if u and v are linearly independent
- 11/08 - case 2 should be tr(a)^2 - 4det(a) < 0, i forgot the ^2
